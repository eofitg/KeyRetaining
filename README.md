# Key Retaining

[PortalInputFix](https://github.com/roccodev/PortalInputFix) but on `1.21.10-fabric`.

This mod lets you input movement actions right after closing GUIs.
Since the "level download" screen is a GUI, this also fixes broken controls after entering portals or changing worlds/dimensions (e.g. switching lobbies).
